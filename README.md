## The task

The Bangalore Public Library has approached us to design and implement a Library Management System for them. Based on their requirements, we have decided to develop a new system named Biblioteca. Since the library has a large list of requirements, we will be making multiple releases of Biblioteca, with each release incrementally adding more functionality.

In order to easily add more functionality in the future as well as maintain a high level of quality, Biblioteca will be built using a test driven approach.

The requirements for the first release of Biblioteca can be found in the [Requirements file](REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Getting started

Clone the repository and open using Intellij IDEA:
```
git clone git@github.com:charlottebrf/twu-biblioteca-charlottefereday.git
```

## Usage

Change directory to the folder:
```
cd src/BibliotecaApp.java
```

Run the main method and interact with the console menu as a user, with the pre-populated library:
```
Click the green arrow on line 44  next to: public static void main(String[] args)
```
